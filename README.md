BORG - Basic Organizational Reinstancing Group
----
The BORG Assymilates hosts and handles provisioning restrictions, ensuring platform enviornmental sanity, dependancy issues, etc. are "just handled" in distributed clusters. This may seem trivial on a few 10's of hosts, but when you're releasing to 100,000 not having to care about these basics really helps. It's secondary task is to allow for broad updates, and to ensure the platform doesn't shoot the service in the face.
